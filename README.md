# AIM: 
   To interface and toggle the led with ARM LPC 1768 microprocessor           
           
# COMPONENTS REQUIRED:
##  HARDWARE:
ARM LPC1768
LED
## SOFTWARE:
KEIL MICRO VISION 4.0 IDE

# PROCEDURE:


⮚	Open the Keil software and select the New uvision project from Project Menu as shown below.

⮚	Browse to your project folder and provide the project name and click on save.

⮚	Once the project is saved a new pop up “Select Device for Target” opens, Select the controller (NXP: LPC1768) from NXP (founded by philips) and click on OK.

⮚	Select the controller (NXP: LPC1768) and click on OK.

⮚	As LPC1768 needs the startup code, click on Yes option to include the LPC17xx Startup file.

⮚	Create a new file by file → new to write the program.

⮚	Type the code.

⮚	After typing the code save the file as main.c eg. (abc.c).

⮚	Right click target and Add the suitable files to source group1 and header for the project.

⮚	Add the main.c along with system_LPC17xx.c.

⮚	Build the project and fix the compiler errors/warnings if any.

⮚	Code is compiled with no errors. The .bin file is still not generated.

⮚	Right Click on Target Options to select the option for generating .bin file.

⮚	Set IROM1 start address as 0x2000. Bootloader will be stored from 0x0000- 0x2000 so application should start from 0x2000

⮚	Write	the	command	to	generate	the .bin file	from
.axf file
Command: fromelf --bin projectname.axf --output filename.bin

⮚	in c/c++ → include paths → desktop (00-libfiles).

⮚	.Bin file is generated after a rebuild.

⮚	Check the project folder for the generated .Bin file.

# ADD FILES:
Target1:
Source group1:
Startuplpc17xx.s, main.c (t), delay.c (t), systemlpc17xx.c (t), gpio.c (t)
Header:
Delay.h, stdutils.h, gpioi.h

# PROGRAM:
```
#include <lpc17xx.h>
#include "delay.h"	//User defined library which conatins the delay routines #include "gpio.h"
#define LED P1_29	// Led is connected to P1.29
/* start the main program */ int main()
{
SystemInit();	//Clock and PLL configuration GPIO_PinFunction(LED,PINSEL_FUNC_0); // Configure Pin for Gpio GPIO_PinDirection(LED,OUTPUT);	// Configure the pin as OUTPUT GPIO_PinWrite(LED,LOW);
while(1)
{
/* Turn On all the leds and wait for 100ms */ GPIO_PinWrite(LED,HIGH);	// Make all the Port pin as high DELAY_ms(100);

GPIO_PinWrite(LED,LOW);	// Make all the Port pin as low DELAY_ms(100);
}
}

```
 
# Output:
<img width="638" height="462" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/78c3a383-b926-414f-a879-6596fd22bd9e" />


# Result:
Thus a LED is interfaced with ARM LPC1768 microprocessor and its blinking was verified successfully.
